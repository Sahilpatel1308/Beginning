#You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
#To work out the love score between two people:

#Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 

#Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 

#Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
